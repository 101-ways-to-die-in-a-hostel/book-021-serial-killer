# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Ingrid Bergstrom
**Nickname/Handle:** @NordicNomad
**Age:** 29
**Nationality:** Swedish
**Occupation:** Former HR Manager, now "finding herself"

## Archetype
**Primary:** The Savvy Solo Traveler

**Secondary traits:**
- Self-proclaimed excellent judge of character
- Quietly competitive with other travelers
- Fiercely independent to the point of stubbornness

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Overconfidence

**How it manifests:**
- Dismisses guidebook safety warnings as "for amateurs"
- Believes her HR background makes her immune to manipulation
- Refuses to acknowledge when her read on someone might be wrong
- Takes pride in going places other travelers avoid

**How it kills them:**
Her certainty that she can spot a predator blinds her to the most obvious one - the friendly Irishman who seems just like all the other nice guys she's met on the road.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 5'9", athletic and lean from months of hiking
- **Hair:** Ash blonde, usually in a practical braid
- **Distinguishing features:** Sharp cheekbones, icy blue eyes, a small scar on her chin from a childhood skiing accident
- **Typical outfit:** Quality outdoor wear - Fjallraven shorts, merino wool tee, sensible hiking sandals

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Confident - becomes dismissive of others' concerns
2. Independent - becomes reluctant to ask for help even when needed

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Condescending - alienates potential allies who might have warned her
2. Stubborn - refuses to reconsider her assessment of Conor even when red flags appear

### Pet Peeves
- Men who assume she needs help because she's traveling alone
- Travelers who read guidebooks in common areas
- People who ask "aren't you scared?" about solo travel

### Fears
- Surface fear: Being seen as a helpless tourist
- Deeper fear: That her mother was right about solo travel being dangerous

## Background

### Origin Story
Raised in an affluent Stockholm suburb by overprotective parents who tracked her location until she was 25. Excelled at everything she tried - school, sports, career. Left a six-figure HR position at Spotify after her engagement ended because she "needed to find out who she was without a plan."

### Why They Travel
Proving she doesn't need anyone - not her ex-fiance, not her parents, not society's expectation that women need protection.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Following the Southeast Asia circuit for eight months. Heard about this hostel in Ljubljana from travelers in Croatia who described it as "authentic" and "off the tourist trail."

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "Actually," "Objectively speaking," "In my experience"
- Avoids words like: "I'm scared," "I don't know," "Help"
- Catchphrases: "I've done this before" / "I'm Swedish, we're very practical"

### Speech Pattern
- Measured, precise sentences
- Rarely asks questions - makes statements
- Slight accent that becomes thicker when drinking
- Tendency to begin sentences with "Well, actually..."

### Internal Monologue Style
Analytical, constantly assessing risk and categorizing people. Reads like a performance review - noting others' strengths and weaknesses with clinical detachment.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram
- **Follower count:** 12,400
- **Posting style:** Carefully curated solo shots with inspirational captions about independence, never shows other travelers
- **Last post before death:** Photo at Ljubljana Dragon Bridge with caption "Month 8: Still haven't been murdered, Mom"

### Online vs Reality
Projects fearless confidence online; privately checks in with her sister daily and has a complicated "if I don't message" safety protocol she's embarrassed to mention.

## Relationships

### Family
- Mother (Annika): Constant worry, daily texts that Ingrid increasingly ignores
- Father (Erik): Supports her journey but secretly agrees with his wife
- Sister (Maja): The only person Ingrid trusts with her real feelings

### Friends
- Left most friendships behind with her old life; hasn't formed deep connections on the road by choice

### Romantic
- Eight months post-breakup, not looking for anything but occasionally lonely

### At the Hostel
- Immediately dismisses the loud American group as "basic"
- Wary of the German couple who seem "too friendly"
- Drawn to Conor's quiet intelligence and Irish charm

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes early, does yoga on the hostel rooftop, smugly notes the other guests sleeping off hangovers. Answers her mother's text with a single "Fine" before breakfast.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Sitting in the common room reading Ferrante, looking up to see Conor making coffee. He offers to make her one too. She thinks: "Finally, someone normal."

### Final Thoughts
A fragmented realization: The HR training about identifying workplace predators. The pattern she should have seen. Her mother's face. The irony that she dies proving everyone right.

### Last Words
"Conor, what are you-"

- They notice: Social dynamics, status signals, who's experienced vs. amateur
