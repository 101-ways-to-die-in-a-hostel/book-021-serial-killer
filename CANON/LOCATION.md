### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
Roznik Hill, a forested area 2km from the hostel. Specifically, an unofficial viewpoint off the main trail, accessible by a path marked only by trampled grass. The spot overlooks Ljubljana from 400m elevation. Surrounded by beech and oak trees. A bench installed by a hiking club provides seating. During sunset, the castle glows amber. The spot is romantic, isolated, and practically invisible from the main trail - perfect for photographs, perfect for murder.

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Maja Kovac
**Description:** Late 30s, tattoo sleeves, former art student who never left. Sharp eyes, dry humor. Knows everyone who stays but pretends not to notice anything.
**Role in death:** Oblivious - Maja saw Ingrid and Conor leave together but hostel etiquette means not tracking guests. Later haunted by the memory.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Branko | Elderly, former prison guard here in the 70s, mutters about "bad energy" in certain cells |
| Security | None | Hostel uses electronic key cards only |
| Bar/Kitchen | Anja | Young, enthusiastic, obvious crush on Conor that makes her blind to his nature |
| Manager | Peter | Rarely present, handles bookings remotely |

### Staff Knowledge
They know nothing about the danger - Conor appears completely normal. After Ingrid's death is discovered, Maja remembers small things that seemed insignificant: how he always knew when guests were leaving, how he volunteered to clear rooms for checkout.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Artistic, contemplative. Guests wander the building photographing each unique cell. Coffee and conversation in the courtyard. Many solo travelers drawn by the aesthetic and history.

### Night Vibe
Transforms into something more electric. The basement bar fills with travelers and locals. Conversations turn philosophical - the prison setting invites reflection on freedom, confinement, choices.

### Guest Demographics
Artists, writers, solo travelers seeking "authentic" experiences, architecture enthusiasts, digital nomads. Fewer party backpackers than typical hostels - the art concept attracts a more introspective crowd.

### Reputation
"Most unique hostel I've ever stayed in." "Like sleeping in a museum." "The bar is incredible - met the most interesting people." "Weird but in the best way." Occasional reviews mention "strange energy" or "vivid dreams."

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
Hostel Celica is a real hostel and should be depicted respectfully while adapting details for fiction. Ljubljana's layout, landmarks, and atmosphere should be accurate. The hiking trail to Roznik is real but the specific viewpoint is fictionalized.

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Slovenia's Yugoslav history should be handled with awareness
- The prison history involves real suffering - balance the "cool converted space" vibe with acknowledgment of this
- Avoid stereotypes about Eastern European danger - the irony is that Ljubljana is extremely safe

### Sources
- Hostel Celica website and guest reviews
- Ljubljana tourism board information
- Personal accounts of Roznik Hill hiking trails
